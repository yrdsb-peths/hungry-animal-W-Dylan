# Dylan's Notes

This here is my Hungry animal assignment
In it I have created the game from the original hungry animal game
The feature I added though is that I have a tutorial for the player
The tutorial starts of with teach you how to move around the screen
Then, it teaches you that touching the apples that fall from the sky 
Makes you eat it.
It's a fun little feature that was annoying to code so I hope you enjoy
It!
